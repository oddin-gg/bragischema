// with (Game)MatchUpdate payload (eg. CsgoMatchUpdate) can be received. Those updates are supposed to be applied on cached
// (Game)MatchSnapshot. If AnnouncementUpdate is received then append its "payload" property value to the array of "announcements"
// in cached (Game)MatchSnapshot. If update (e.g. CsgoMatchUpdate) payload is received then apply this update on "match_state"
// property in cached (Game)MatchSnapshot. For both update cases do not forget also to update "sequence" and "timestamp"
// properties in the cached (Game)MatchSnapshot with values from the received (Game)MatchMessage.
